            <p>Ramalinga as usual was walking into the Bhuvana Vijayam premises and the guards stopped him. He
                questioned
                why were they blocking the way. The soldiers told Ramalinga about the line and asked him to enter the
                premises only after reciting the first three lines for the last line they recited to him. Ramalinga
                boiled
                and trembled with anger on those soldiers. </p>
